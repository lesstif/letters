Dearest,

A bit ago I learned that my great-great grandfather tried to commit suicide after the financial collapse of Columbia Records. In the on-going story of my family struggling to cope with my grandmother’s illness this is scary, and dramatic, and it makes me wonder a great deal about my own happiness, and future, and ability to live in accordance with the way I want to live and in accordance with the way I want to affect the lives of the people around me until the very end, those last moments, those final days. It makes me worry about you, and the things you say, and the way you act, and I will never not be scared, I think. Inviting people into your life is a surefire way to introduce fear but to not is to only have loneliness.

It rained very heavily today. The living room and world seem to be bathed in yellow light.

Recently (recently? A few days ago? A while back? I’m uncertain) my mother and father learned that my grandfather owns a .45 in the house somewhere, and vowed tonight that they would go over and remove it. My grandfather has been bemoaning life and living for a long time now, but after weeks of not showering and days of not eating and learning of the gun have rolled into a massive concern for his well-being. They have steamrolled into such a problem that now, as I type this, my mother is driving over there to meet my father and remove it from the house and I am scared, so scared, that I am so far physically removed from it all and will sit here waiting until it is over, doing nothing, contributing nothing, just feeling wrinkles sink into my skin and feeling the affects of each second on my skin.

As always,

—Helen

P.S. The world is never so beautiful as after it rains.
