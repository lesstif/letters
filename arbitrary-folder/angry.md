Hello,

Today we got into a fight. I am still very, very angry, but anger always seems to fight again exhaustion in these scenarios. I do not, however, feel like telling you that yet.

I want to spend the day doodling line drawings but cannot because I am part of the rat race.

Sincerely,

—Helen

_PostScript:_ I may end up doodling all day anyway.
