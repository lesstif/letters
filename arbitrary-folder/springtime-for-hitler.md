Dearest,

My grandfather once played The Producers soundtrack in his home as he was wont to do. Both my grandparents loved listening to music, and would let it play so constantly around their home that the silence when they wanted to read felt so stark and alien despite that being normal as well. I suppose it felt strange because they didn’t have a tv as constant background noise, like people do in most houses.

In any case I still, even now and almost a decade later, burst into song when alone singing “Springtime for Hitler and Germany! Winter for Poland and France!”

Odd, the things you remember the most.

Love,

As always,

Helen
