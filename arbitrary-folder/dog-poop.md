Dearest,

Today while driving I had a memory of something that hadn’t happened yet. I was on the road, imagining you with your first job, and us living in New York, and I was late to meet you after your first day so I’m rushing it and feeling dumb for having paid for a job from the metro station even though it was only 10 blocks away, and then seeing you, and getting teary. I imagined that I’d walk up and apologize for being late and adjust your tie and tell you that I was so, so proud of you.

Then I saw you had texted me about the dog shitting on the rug because I had fed her the dog biscuits that had gone bad and felt stupid. You tried to hang up and I stopped you, told you I loved you, and you said it back but only because I had stopped you to say it first. I felt pretty dumb.

With love,

Helen
