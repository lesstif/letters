Dearest,

I learned somewhere (the "where", of course, discarded by my brain most voraciously, as are most contextual facts) that people used to have books where they wrote their favorite quotes and bits of knowledge, as paper was expensive. Thus, the books became precious, both for their paper and for their contents.

Isn't it a pity, don't you believe, that the same sort of reverence doesn't exist anywhere? The Internet has allowed us to bookmark our favorite bits to then forget them. This is a problem that I have, at least.

Always with love,

Helen
